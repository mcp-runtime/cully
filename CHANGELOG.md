# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Harden Team workspace invariants: keep a project maintainer when removing a team member, reject cancelled dependencies and canceling tasks that still have open dependents, allow project writers to cancel ready tasks, require completed tasks before lesson drafts, prefer published lessons over drafts in `lessons`, and keep team-scoped audit events free of client `project_id`. Restore installer setup without a default `--agent codex`. Fold implemented design pages into team workflows and product vision; remove the standalone team-workspace and shared-learning design docs.
- Split E2E coverage into Solo setup/memory/session checks and an authenticated Team handoff, review, sharing and revocation workflow using production binaries. Refactor workspace routing into focused access, task, review and learning handlers with one shared action contract; fix the Go formatting failure.
- Introduce the manual-launch Team workspace alongside Solo's agent copilot: OAuth-scoped project roles, stable tasks/dependencies, atomic claims, board/inbox, portable checkpoints, revision-pinned reported evidence and noncontributing-maintainer acceptance. Add transactional audit events, private lesson drafts, explicit project publication/edit/withdrawal and source-validated playbook adoption through MCP and `cully workspace`; private memory and journals stay separate. Update the website tagline, product vision, mode guides, architecture, privacy, deployment and capability docs. Migration 006 is required; managed execution and automatic learning remain planned.
- Fix two macOS test harness issues: resolve temporary-directory symlinks when checking child working directories, and drain terminal output during the hangup test.

- Install one Cully binary at `~/.local/bin/cully` and link agent command paths to it, migrating older Cully copies. Installer logs show versions, paths, migrations and terminal refresh instructions; full uninstall removes managed agent links.
- Require `cully setup --all` for a full local setup or `--mcp-url URL` for a deployed server, reject positional agent names, and verify MCP initialization and Cully tool discovery. Local setup streams build progress and identifies failed stages; OAuth verification remains pending until agent sign-in.

## 0.10.2

- In Warp, the Cully terminal no longer enables mouse tracking at startup. That mode was consuming Warp scroll mode and the host mouse wheel. Mouse tracking turns on only while the advisor drawer is open (Ctrl+] / F6) and turns off again when it closes. Other terminals keep click-to-open on the compact panel.

## 0.10.1

- In the Cursor (and other no-usage-feed) terminal panel, show Model and Context as unavailable instead of "waiting for agent". Cursor has no Codex footer or Claude statusline feed for those instruments; Tokens and rate limits already said unavailable. Claude and Codex still wait for their real feeds.

## 0.10.0

- Define explicit session task-link semantics: omitting the task keeps the current link, a new name links it, and `clear_task` in `cully_session` unlinks it while keeping the task record. Repeating a task name after a clear relinks the kept record instead of adding a duplicate. `cully_update` can no longer move a linked task entry to another section, and deleting a task entry clears only the link. The deployment manifests now gate all eleven registered tools, and a contract test keeps registration, manifests and the skill in agreement.
- Refactor the terminal core without changing behavior: one agent catalog replaces the scattered per-agent switches, shared Codex-named panel types use neutral names, and footer/snapshot feeds parse through explicit updates with a documented merge contract. On-disk paths, hook commands, panel output and goldens are unchanged.
- Show researched tool suggestions only when the advisor's web scout reports a successful search.
- Fix the compact panel in Claude and other non-Codex agents: it no longer shows a Fast row, and a Cully MCP result sent as a string of JSON text now counts as healthy and authenticated.
- Add Subagents, Web and Commits counters to the panel's activity rows. Subagent (`Task`/`Agent`) calls, web fetches and searches, and `git commit` commands are counted from tool events without recording their arguments.
- Fix the panel's Cully MCP health and Auth rows in Claude Code: a successful tool result sent as an array of content blocks now counts as healthy and authenticated instead of staying "unknown".
- Add sessions and tasks to the memory schema (migration 004): a `cully_sessions` table with project, branch, assistant and a linked task, a `task` entry type, and the MCP tools `cully_session` (start or update a session, optionally with a task) and `cully_session_get`. The migration is additive; existing records, tools and the `entry_type` values `work`, `issue`, `learning` and `decision` are unchanged.
- Make the terminal panel agent-neutral: in Claude it now shows Claude's model, tokens, limits and line changes from its statusline feed, says "waiting for Claude" instead of "waiting for Codex" when data is missing, and hides the Codex-only Fast row.
- Fix review findings on sessions and tasks: the capabilities page now lists the session task as partial instead of planned, task names are capped at 60 characters in both the CLI and `cully_session`, `cully_log` rejects `entry_type: task` in favour of `cully_session`, the task file uses owner-only permissions, task suggestions wait for three edits, concurrent `cully_session` calls serialize per session with a PostgreSQL-safe lock key, and constraint validation runs after the exclusive migration lock is released. Session updates reject section changes, and advisor refreshes retain Claude's panel metrics.
- Add a Task row to the health panel. When a session has edits and no task, Cully suggests one from the Git branch ("Looks like you're working on ... Add it as the task to Cully"); accept it with `cully apply <n>`, or set it with `cully task NAME`. The Cully skill then records the accepted task through the new `cully_session` tool and links it to the session. Progress is not shown yet because the journal has no measured source for it.
- Keep free-form command arguments out of session journal labels, count `create_file` and `notebookedit` as edits, and reconcile individual untracked files and rename destinations in replay.
- Reposition Cully as the intelligent workspace around coding agents ("Your coding agents need a copilot too"): rewrite the README, homepage, docs introduction, agents guide and Cully skill, and add how-it-works, terminal, session intelligence, privacy, capabilities and product-direction pages. Remove the "better work and everyday life" tagline from the CLI help, MCP instructions and skill metadata.
- Add `cully run AGENT [ARGS...]`, which starts Claude Code, Codex, `cursor-agent` or any executable in the same Cully terminal that `cully codex` used. `cully claude`, `cully codex` and `cully cursor` are shortcuts. Cully still needs macOS or Linux for the terminal.
- Add an Agent Health bar to the terminal: agent, project and branch, session time, context, loops and unchecked edits. Segments with no data are omitted.
- Add a local session journal fed by asynchronous tool-event hooks for Claude Code, Codex and Cursor. It records time, agent, kind of tool, pass or fail and a one-way command hash, and never prompts, file contents, command arguments or output. Run `cully setup` again to install the new Claude Code and Cursor hooks.
- Add loop detection (the same command failing three times, or three edit and failed-check cycles) and a project workflow hint when edits have not been checked.
- Add `cully replay`: a step player, file activity with hotspots, a reconcile check against `git status`, `--json` output and a self-contained offline `--html` export. File paths come from structured file tools. A shell command records its program and recognized subcommand only. Set `CULLY_JOURNAL_PATHS=0` to stop recording paths and command labels.
- Keep session risk on a loop that is still happening. A resolved loop stays in the count and no longer marks the session HIGH. Journal pruning keeps the newest sessions per project, and journal writes lock the file.
- Add `cully timeline`, `cully handoff` and `cully rescue`, and a measured session health block with a rule-based risk label in `cully status`.
- Add a [use cases](docs/use-cases.md) page positioning the shipped primitives as a flight recorder for agent sessions, audit-grade session review and replayable playbooks, with a matching section on the homepage.
- Claude Code's status line stays silent inside the Cully terminal and feeds the panel instead. It behaves as before outside the terminal.

## 0.9.1

- Run a single end-to-end CI check that follows the documented path: install, `cully setup`, MCP use and uninstall, replacing the separate compose-only job.
- Describe Cully in the docs introduction as a companion for work and everyday life, not only session resume and guidance.

## 0.9.0

- `cully setup` now runs the local stack without OAuth on port 3393 for Cully MCP and fixed uncommon loopback ports for the data API, Mem0 and both databases, picks the next free port when one is busy, saves the choice in `.env`, and keeps ports of an already running stack.

## 0.8.3

- Preserve richer Cully MCP counts when an older running wrapper rewrites its earlier state schema during an upgrade, using a private thread-scoped counter snapshot.
- Add an opt-in live check confirming an advisor's actual semantic Cully call reaches its linked session counter without increasing foreground activity.

## 0.8.2

- Count every observed Cully MCP tool by name across foreground, advisor and startup calls, with saved combined and per-source totals restored on resume.
- Show all Cully tool counts in expanded session instruments and distinguish semantic context recall from direct recall calls.
- Preserve earlier category totals during telemetry upgrades, without inventing names for previously grouped Other calls.

## 0.8.1

- Reduce panel row spacing: adjacent metric rows, one blank row after section titles and between major sections; keep the three-column gap.
- Restore saved same-thread instruments before the first panel frame when resuming an explicit Codex thread ID, while the resume picker loads them on SessionStart.
- Check Cully MCP through the coding agent's configured identity after opening a thread; only actual response hooks update health/authentication, without adding probe calls to foreground counters.

## 0.8.0

- Organize the Codex pane into Model & activity, Project & usage, and Cully MCP groups, with aligned columns on wide screens and consistent spacing when stacked.
- Add a small uniform gap between wide-panel metric rows and a larger break before the advisor, shedding optional spacing first on short screens.
- Count directly observed Cully MCP calls per session, including log/context/recall/search/get, and show last-observed health/authentication with explicit unknown and failure states.
- Show verified MCP health as a green Healthy or red Unhealthy heading badge, with a clear awaiting-response startup state and no duplicate Health row.
- Save private thread-scoped MCP and tool totals, verification state and native model/context/token/quota instruments locally; restore them when resuming the same Codex thread and keep different threads isolated.
- Keep the last observed native token totals when a narrow footer omits them, and replace cumulative totals without double counting.
- Omit Codex cost/cache placeholders when reliable billable cost is unavailable; retain model, context and token usage.

## 0.7.0

- Make the Codex pane's row spacing consistent within each section, with a single separator row between identity, instruments, advice and controls.
- Require a changelog update in every PR through repository instructions, a PR checklist and a dedicated CI check.
- Add a compact full-width Codex pane with two prioritized comments, suggestion/tip counts and an interactive advisor opened by mouse or Ctrl+] / F6.
- Preview and accept advice with mouse/arrow selection and Enter; apply supported shared instruction/skill changes locally or hand task actions to the current coding input without discarding its draft.
- Share owner-scoped memory recall and targeted research across Claude, Codex and Cursor advisor workers, with isolated native CLI adapters and clear startup/source status.
- Add an evidence-based red Messy phase, terminal-aware command guidance, native-background styling and adaptive group spacing while retaining full session instruments.
- Release Codex sessions and process descendants when the wrapper exits or loses its terminal.

## 0.6.1

- Bind Codex pane signals to their SessionStart session when hooks run through a persistent app server, without saving prompts or tool output.
- Document the distinct Claude, Codex and Cursor surfaces, live signal checks, and local CLI setup with a remote MCP/data/Mem0 stack.

## 0.6.0

- Replace `cully agent setup` with one `cully setup` command for local services, detected agent integrations and the advisor; use `--mcp-url` for existing servers.
- Log startup stages and return errors when the advisor or another component fails; keep `--prepare` configuration-only.
- Install project hooks in the caller's directory, and have the installer direct local users to the complete setup command.

## Earlier changes

- Accept GitHub source archives with global PAX headers so the published CLI can download and start its matching self-hosted stack.
- Clarify that `cully setup` prepares configuration and starts the full local stack; `--prepare` stops before starting services for team configuration.
- Add `cully uninstall` for local Docker and agent cleanup, with explicit `--purge-data` for memory deletion.
- Combine local agent guidance and shared memory as Cully.
- Rename the local command, agent integrations, MCP tools and configuration to Cully.
- Port the MCP and private memory data services from Python to Go.
- Add self-hosted Mem0 semantic recall with transactional indexing retries, source hydration and deletion propagation.
- Store authoritative records in plain PostgreSQL with owner isolation, full-text search and IST timestamps; use Mem0 for semantic recall.
- Add an explicit fresh-database schema, VM cutover documentation, separate CI checks, database E2E and server container builds.
- Add separate website/docs delivery and a gated personal-service release workflow.
